        <h3 class="descriptionhead">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The University of California (UC) Libraries 3D Scanning Data Atlas is a collaboration among librarians and
            library
            staff at UC Santa Cruz, UC Davis, UC Riverside, UC Los Angeles, UC San Francisco, and UC Berkeley. All
            participating
            libraries are part of the University of California 3D Data Common Knowledge Group (CKG). The goal of the
            atlas is to
            create a collection of 3D scanned reference objects using different 3D scanning technologies available at UC
            Libraries.
            <br> <br>
            The 3D Scanning Data Atlas provides qualitative, quantitative, and visual information to effectively
            evaluate
            how the 3D scanners available across the UC Library system interact with different types of materials and
            how they
            compare to one another. The objects chosen for 3D scanning represent various material properties important
            in the 3D
            scanning process. We hope the 3D Scanning Data Atlas enables campus constituents to make informed decisions
            about
            which 3D scanning option best fits their education and research needs and provides librarians and library
            staff with
            data to make informed purchases.
        </p>

    <div class="description">

        <h3 class="descriptionhead">Objects 3D Scanned</h3>
        <p>
            We chose seven objects based on the following requirements: low-cost; easily accessible and
            relatively
            future-proof for reproduction; represent different sizes, materials, interior structures, and
            reflectivity.
            <br>
            <br>
            The following objects were purchased and shipped to five of the participating UC Libraries:
            <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Nut bolt thread gauge for capturing measurement accuracy</li>
            <li>Stainless steel hex head screw for capturing measurement accuracy and shine</li>
            <li>Human skull model for capturing cavities and crevices</li>
            <li>Fuzzy dice for capturing fuzzy texture</li>
            <li>Ornaments (silver and blue) for capturing multiple colors and shine</li>
            <li>Christmas box ornaments (gold and black/white) for capturing shine, cloth, and string</li>
            <li>Chess piece for capturing frosted glass</li>
            <li>Chess piece, clear, no scanner able to capture.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Funding for the 3D Scanning Data Atlas project was provided through a Librarians Association of the
        University of
        California (LAUC) Mini Grant.

        <h3 class="descriptionhead">3D scanners</h3>
        The 3D Data Atlas includes a range of 3D scanners currently available across UC Libraries.
        The following
        criteria were identified for comparing the 3D scanners: resolution; ability to capture
        transparency/semi-transparency, cavities, and reflectivity; time to 3D scan; and price.

        <br>The following 3D scanners and digital cameras were used to use scan the objects at the
        respective libraries:
        <ul>
            <li>Artec Space Spider (UCLA)</li>
            <li>Canon 6D (UCSC)</li>
            <li>Einscan-SE (UCR)</li>
            <li>Einscan-SP (UCSF)</li>
            <li>Einscan Pro (UCB)</li>
            <li>Einscan Pro 2X with HD attachment (UCSC)</li>
            <li>Einscan Pro 2X with Color attachment (UCSC)</li>
            <li>iPhone 13 (UCSF, UCSD, UCLA, UCSC)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="descriptionhead">3D scanning process</h3>
        The 3D CKG members have a range of experience using 3D scanning technology. 3D CKG
        members agreed on the
        following process that would be beneficial for both novice and experts:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the 3D scanner manufacturer’s software to 3D scan whenever possible
            </li>
            <li> Use default settings in 3D scanning software whenever possible
            </li>
            <li>Follow manufacturer documentation rather than bringing in any personal knowledge
                about scanning
            </li>
            <li> Use only lighting from environment and avoid using additional lighting
            </li>
            <li> Time how long it takes to complete the 3D scanning process from start to finish
            </li>
            <li> Export as both OBJ and STL whenever possible
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The 3D CKG members acknowledge that there are a number of ways to improve the outcome of
        3D scans (e.g., using
        additional lighting, powder coating, etc). We intentionally did not apply previous 3D
        scanning knowledge or
        techniques. Rather, we simply followed the manufacturers’ instructions. The intention is
        to produce 3D models
        for the Atlas that someone with minimal 3D scanning experience could expect.

        <h3 class="descriptionhead">Comparison of 3D scanners by object</h3>
        The 3D Scanning Data Atlas is powered by the Potree Viewer and is hosted by
        UCLA. See the figure below for
        instructions on using the viewer.

        <br> <br>
        Below are the OBJs produced for each of the nine objects:

        <h3 class="descriptionhead">Conclusion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Found that inexpensive 3D scanners can produce usable scans based on the characteristics of the object being scanned.  
            </li>
            <li>High-power, expensive 3D scanners tend to consistently produce better results.  
            </li>
            <li>University of California 3D Data Common Knowledge Group learned of the 3D scanning capabilities across UC Libraries. This can be helpful for collaboration and research within the UC Library system.
            </li>
            <li>
            We hope the 3D Scanning Data Atlas enables campus constituents to make informed decisions about which 3D scanning option best fits their education and research needs and provides librarians and library staff with data to make informed purchases.
            </li>
            
            
        </ul>
        We want to emphasize that this Atlas was designed so that other institutions can contribute their scanning methods to the Atlas. To do so, they should contact dougdaniels@library.ucla.edu.
        

        We noticed that a lot of scans were totally unusable, while also notbeing a true representation of what we knew
        the scanners to be capable of. Thus: We are going to rescan some.
