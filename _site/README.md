# Project Title

UC 3D Data Atlas Website

## Description

The 3D Scanning Data Atlas provides qualitative, quantitative, and visual information to effectively evaluate how the 3D scanners available across the UC Library system interact with different types of materials and how they compare to one another. The objects chosen for 3D scanning represent various material properties important in the 3D scanning process. We hope the 3D Scanning Data Atlas enables campus constituents to make informed decisions about which 3D scanning option best fits their education and research needs and provides librarians and library staff with data to make informed purchases.
